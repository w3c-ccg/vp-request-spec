      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
When working with Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifier (DID) based
Authentication, and Authorization Capabilities, a client application often needs
to request credential-related objects from a wallet or agent. This document
presents a specification that describes the format of those requests.
      </p>

      <p>
Note: This specification is unstable at present, and only reflects an effort to
get initial interop working, for incubation and implementation experience.
Additionally, the intention is to align this spec and the query format to
fit into/work with other protocols/messaging formats such as DIDComm.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2 id="format">Request Overview</h2>

      <p>
To make a request for one or more objects wrapped in a Verifiable Presentation,
a <a>client</a> constructs a JSON request describing one or more queries that
it wishes to perform from the receiver.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A sample query">
{
  query: [{
    type: 'APopularQueryType',
    // query details ...
  }, {
    type: 'AnotherQueryType',
    // query details ...
  }],

  // Challenge that will be digitally signed in the authentication proof
  // that will be attached to the VerifiablePresentation response
  challenge, // Required
  recipients: [
    // an optional key agreement key for encrypting the response if
    // this is supported
  ]
}
      </pre>

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2 id="format">Query Types</h2>

      <p>
The <a>query type</a> serves as the main extension point mechanism for
requests for data in the presentation. This document defines several common query
types.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Query By Example</h3>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A Query By Example query">
{
  query: [{
    type: 'QueryByExample',
    credentialQuery: [{ // One or more example query entries

      // may be shown to a user by their wallet software

        <h3>Browser - Credential Handler API (CHAPI)</h3>

        <p>
The [Credential Handler API (CHAPI)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/)
specification enables in-browser Javascript applications to communicate with
wallet providers for the purpose of issuing Verifiable Credentials and
requesting Verifiable Presentations. Interested implementers are encouraged
to look at the [Credential Handler Polyfill](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/credential-handler-polyfill))
repository for further discussion and examples.
        </p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>WebCredential</h4>

          <p>
A VerifiablePresentation is used to both store or present VerifiableCredentials.
When storing a VerifiableCredential, the VerifiablePresentation does not need to
be signed.
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Creating a WebCredential instance.">
const webCredential = new WebCredential('VerifiablePresentation', {
  '@context': 'https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1',
  ...presentation
});
          </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Requesting and Storing Credentials</h4>

          <p>
Using CHAPI, a web application can <code>get()</code> and <code>store()</code>
credentials without knowing anything about the user's wallet. This is
intentional; for privacy reasons, the client app must not be able to query any
information (without user consent) about which wallets or credential handlers a
user may have installed (otherwise, fingerprinting and other attacks would be
possible).
          </p>

          <h4>get()</h4>

          <p>
A web app (a Relying Party or verifier) can request a credential using
<code>credentials.get()</code> during a user gesture event, for example when
the user pushes a button on a page that requires identity attributes or
authentication.
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Example get() request.">
const credentialQuery = {
  web: {
    VerifiablePresentation: {
      query: {
        type: 'QueryByExample',
        credentialQuery: {
          // an optional reason for requesting this credential that
          // may be shown to a user by their wallet software
          reason: 'We need you to prove your eligibility to work.',
          example: {
            '@context': [
              'https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1',
              'https://w3id.org/citizenship/v1'
            ],
            type: 'PermanentResidentCard'
          }
        }
      },
      // a 128-bit randomly generated value encoded as a string (use a UUID);
      // it will be digitally signed in the authentication proof
      // that will be attached to the VerifiablePresentation response
      challenge: '3182bdea-63d9-11ea-b6de-3b7c1404d57f',
      // the domain that must be digitally signed in the authentication
      // proof that will be attached to the VerifiablePresentation
      // response, identifying the recipient
      domain: 'jobs.example.com'
    }
  }
};
const webCredential = await navigator.credentials.get(credentialQuery);

if(!webCredential) {
  console.log('no presentation received');
}
const {data: presentation} = webCredential;
// send `presentation` to server for forwarding to verifier API
          </pre>


          <h4>store()</h4>

          <p>
A web app (for example, a credential issuer such as a university or institution)
can ask to store a credential during a user gesture event, for example when the
user pushes a button to receive a credential.
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Requesting via get().">
const result = await navigator.credentials.store(webCredential);
if(!result) {
  console.log('store credential operation canceled');
