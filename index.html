      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
When working with Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifier (DID) based
Authentication, and Authorization Capabilities, a client application often needs
to request credential-related objects from a wallet or agent. This document
presents a specification that describes the format of those requests.
      </p>

      <p>
Note: This specification is unstable at present, and only reflects an effort to
get initial interop working, for incubation and implementation experience.
Additionally, the intention is to align this spec and the query format to
fit into/work with other protocols/messaging formats such as DIDComm.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
To make a request for one or more objects wrapped in a Verifiable Presentation,
a client constructs a JSON request describing one or more queries that
it wishes to perform from the receiver.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A sample query">
{
  query: [{
    type: 'APopularQueryType',
    // query details ...
  }, {
    type: 'AnotherQueryType',
    // query details ...
  }],

  // Challenge that will be digitally signed in the authentication proof
  // that will be attached to the VerifiablePresentation response
  challenge, // Required
  recipients: [
    // an optional key agreement key for encrypting the response if
    // this is supported
  ],
  interact: {
    // an optional set of mechanisms that can be used to respond to the query
    "service": [{
      // a service that can be used to respond to the query where the service
      // might be an HTTP endpoint, bluetooth location, or P2P protocol
    }]
  }
}

        <h3>DID Authentication</h3>

        <p>
This section defines how a <a>verifier</a> can request that a
<a>holder</a> perform Decentralized Identifier-based Authentication
[[?DID-CORE]]. In its simplest form, the authentication protocol is comprised
of a challenge by the <a>verifier</a> and a response by a <a>holder</a>:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="A DID Authentication request">
{
  "query": [{
    "type": "DIDAuthentication",
    "acceptedMethods": [{"method": "example"}]
  }],
  "challenge": "99612b24-63d9-11ea-b99f-4f66f3e4f81a",
  "domain": "example.com"
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The DID Authentication request above specifies that the <a>verifier</a> would
like the <a>holder</a> to demonstrate control over a DID by generating a
digital signature over the provided challenge. The <a>holder</a> might respond
by providing the following response:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="A DID Authentication response">
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2022/credentials/v2"],
  "type": "VerifiablePresentation",
  "holder": "did:example:12345",
  "proof": {
    "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
    "cryptosuite": "eddsa-2022",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:12345#key-1",
    "challenge": "99612b24-63d9-11ea-b99f-4f66f3e4f81a",
    "domain": "example.com",
    "created": "2022-02-25T14:58:42Z",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "proofValue": "z3FXQjecWufY46...UAUL5n2Brbx"
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p class="issue">
The DID Authentication examples shown in this document use a new proof type
called `DataIntegrityProof` which is currently under development in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working
Group</a>.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>The DID Authentication Query Format</h3>

          <p>
The DID Authentication query format enables a <a>verifier</a> to request that
a <a>holder</a> authenticate in specific ways. A DID Authentication query MUST
be of the following form:
          </p>
          <table class="simple">
            <tr>
              <th>Property</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>type</td>
              <td>
a REQUIRED string value that MUST be set to <code>DIDAuthentication</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>acceptedMethods</td>
              <td>
An optional array of objects that expresses the <a>verifier</a> would accept
any DID Method listed. Each object in the array MUST contain a property called
`method` with a value that is a DID Method name, and MAY contain other
properties that are specific to the DID Method. Valid example values
include: <code>[{"method": "key"}]</code> and
<code>[{"method": "key"}, {"method": "web"}]</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>acceptedCryptosuites</td>
              <td>
An optional array of objects that conveys the cryptography suites that MUST be
used by the <a>holder</a> to generate a cryptographic proof. Each object in the
array MUST contain a property called `cryptosuite` with a value that is a
cryptosuite name, and MAY contain other properties that are specific to the
cryptosuite. Valid example values include:
<code>[{"cryptosuite": "eddsa-2022"}]</code> and
<code>[{"cryptosuite": "ecdsa-2022"}, {"cryptosuite": "bbs-2022"}]</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>
The following example demonstrates that the <a>verifier</a> would like the
<a>holder</a> to utilize the DID Web method and the 2022 ECDSA cryptography
suite to authenticate over the established communication channel, such as the
Credential Handler API (CHAPI):
          </p>

          <pre class="example"
            title="A DID Authentication request using did:web and ecdsa-2022">
{
  "query": [{
    "type": "DIDAuthentication",
    "acceptedMethods": [{"method": "key"}],
    "acceptedCryptosuites": [{"cryptosuite": "ecdsa-2022"}]
  }],
  "challenge": "99612b24-63d9-11ea-b99f-4f66f3e4f81a",
  "domain": "example.com"
}
          </pre>

          <p>
The next example demonstrates that the <a>verifier</a> would like the
<a>holder</a> to utilize either the DID Key or DID Web method, and the 2022 EdDSA
cryptography suite, and optionally also include a cryptographic proof that they
are capable of performing a 2022 BBS proof, and authenticate over a different
communication channel, in this case utilizing a Verifiable Credential API HTTP
endpoint:
          </p>

          <pre class="example" title="A complex DID Authentication request">
{
  "query": [{
    "type": "DIDAuthentication",
    "acceptedMethods": [{"method": "key"}, {"method": "web"}],
    "acceptedCryptosuites": [{"cryptosuite": "ecdsa-2022"}]
  }, {
    "type": "DIDAuthentication",
    "required": false,
    "acceptedMethods": [{"method": "key"}, {"method": "web"}],
    "acceptedCryptosuites": [{"cryptosuite": "bbs-2022"}]
  }],
  "challenge": "zLEwtBYgQVNR4tyeo",
  "domain": "didauth.example",
  "interact": {
    "service": [{
      "type": "UnmediatedHttpPresentationService2021",
      "serviceEndpoint": "https://didauth.example/exchanges/zYRo25k7G2UVWkrNt"
    }]
  }
}
          </pre>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The DID Authentication Response Format</h3>

          <p>
The DID Authentication response format enables a <a>holder</a> to
provide the information requested by the <a>verifier</a>. A DID Authentication
response MUST be a <a>verifiable presentation</a> of the following form:
          </p>
          <table class="simple">
            <tr>
              <th>Property</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>type</td>
              <td>
a REQUIRED string value that MUST be set to <code>VerifiablePresentation</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>holder</td>
              <td>
a REQUIRED string value that MUST be set to a specific DID that is of the
type that was requested in the DID Authentication query.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>proof</td>
              <td>
a REQUIRED value that MUST be one or more specific digital proof types that
were requested in the DID Authentication query. Each proof object MUST
include the `domain` and `challenge` values that were provided in the DID
Authentication query. <a>Holder</a> implementations MUST ensure that the `domain` specified
by the <a>verifier</a> matches the domain used for the current channel of
communication.
              </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p class="advisement">
It is vital that a <a>holder</a> implementation check the `domain` provided by the
`verifier` against the domain used for the current channel of communication. If
this is not done, a dishonest <a>verifier</a> could then replay the message
to a domain that is not their own. For example, a dishonest <a>verifier</a>
operating from the `evil.example` domain could retrieve a challenge from your
bank, specify a domain value of `yourbank.example`, and then replay
your response to your bank to get access to your financial accounts. This
attack is mitigated as long as implementations ensure that the appropriate
domain is used when generating the <a>verifiable presentation</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The example below demonstrates a simple DID Authentication response.
        </p>

        <h3>Browser - Credential Handler API (CHAPI)</h3>

        <p>
The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential
Handler API (CHAPI)</a> specification enables in-browser Javascript applications
to communicate with wallet providers for the purpose of issuing Verifiable
Credentials and requesting Verifiable Presentations. Interested implementers are
encouraged to look at the <a
href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/credential-handler-polyfill">Credential
Handler Polyfill</a> repository for further discussion and examples.
        </p>

        <p>
        CHAPI is an extension of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/">Credential
        Management API</a>, and includes the following:

        <ul>
          <li><code>navigator.credentials.get(request)</code></li>
          <li><code>navigator.credentials.store(request)</code></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
A VerifiablePresentation is used to both store or present VerifiableCredentials.
When storing a VerifiableCredential, the VerifiablePresentation does not need to
be signed.
        </p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>WebCredential</h4>

          <p>
CHAPI provides a single derived class, the <code>WebCredential</code> that forms
the basis for any sort of credential data that is provided over the Web, i.e.,
via a "Credential Handler" that a origin has registered in the user's browser
when the user visited that origin's website. Note that CHAPI provides an
optional <code>recommendedHandlerOrigins</code> feature for any credential
storage request to allow a Relying Party (aka issuer) to suggest one or more
digital wallets to help the user store the credential. This is particularly
helpful if the user has no wallet yet. The listed origins must have a
`manifest.json` file with a valid `credential_handler` entry in order to
be used by CHAPI.
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Creating a WebCredential instance.">
// optionally include `recommendedHandlerOrigins` so the user can choose an
// applicable wallet if they don't have one yet:
const options = {
  recommendedHandlerOrigins: [
    'https://wallet.example'
  ]
};
const webCredential = new WebCredential('VerifiablePresentation', {
  '@context': 'https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1',
  ...presentation,
  options
});
          </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Requesting and Storing Credentials</h4>

          <p>
Using CHAPI, a web application can <code>get()</code> and <code>store()</code>
credentials without knowing anything about the user's wallet. This is
intentional; for privacy reasons, the client app must not be able to query any
information (without user consent) about which wallets or credential handlers a
user may have installed (otherwise, fingerprinting and other attacks would be
possible).
          </p>

          <h4>get()</h4>

          <p>
A web app (a Relying Party or verifier) can request a credential using
<code>credentials.get()</code> during a user gesture event, for example when
the user pushes a button on a page that requires identity attributes or
authentication. Note that CHAPI provides an optional
<code>recommendedHandlerOrigins</code> feature for any credential
request (not specific or restricted to VPR) to allow a Relying Party
(aka verifier) to suggest one or more digital wallets to help the user
complete the request. This is particularly helpful if the user has no
wallet yet. The listed origins must have a
`manifest.json` file with a valid `credential_handler` entry in order to
be used by CHAPI.
